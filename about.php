A group of friends decide it might be fun to predict football match results in advance, and compare them against the real match result using a scoring system involving Bruce Forsyth. Yes, you heard me.

Predikta is software based on the spreadsheet and ideas of the group, to handle the predictions tracking and make Luke's life that little bit easier.
